# flutter-note-app


flutter Packages:
after adding new package we need to run flutter clear in terminal
this will delete the build folder, then, we stop and start debugging the project again
and this will create the new build folder with the new package

widget AwesomeDialog : (https://pub.dev/packages/awesome_dialog)
in properioty desc: we can only add string
if you want to add a widget in tthe alert then replace the desc: with body: 
and you can add any widget you want in the alert now !
